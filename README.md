# Analysis of longitudinal data
Scripts for the analysis of longitudinal data in R

**Material for the Course "Introduction to the analysis of longitudinal data with R"**

Instructors: *Filippo Biscarini, Andreia Amaral*

This course will introduce students, researchers and professionals to the analysis of longitudinal data, i.e. data with a time component. The course will describe the main types of longitudinal data (e.g. treatments over timepoints, time series data), and a number of approaches to process and analyse such data.

Each day the course will start at **14:00** and end at **20:00** (CET).
As a general rule, we'll have a longer break (30 minutes) at 16:00 and two shorter breaks (10-15 minutes) later on during the day (to be decided flexibly depending on the sessions).
